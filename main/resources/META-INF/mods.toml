This mod is a complete re-coding of the Enviromine mod that was popular back in the 1.7.10 days of Minecraft.  Coded to have more core features and less bloat, it does away with the cave dimension and instead focuses on the complete overhaul of the survival system to make Minecraft more than just munching bread and spamming torches.
